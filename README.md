# GFA-Basic-32

Some old functions and programms in `GFA-Basic-32` to calculate typical school math problems and integral calculations.

While `GFA-Basic` is now outdated, the programmed functions are still elegant and efficient. Grandpa would be happy if someone would take the effort to translate the whole thing into Python. :-)
