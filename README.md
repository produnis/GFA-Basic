# GFA-Basic-32

Some old functions and programms in `GFA-Basic-32` to calculate typical school math problems and integral calculations.

While `GFA-Basic` is now outdated, the programmed functions are still elegant and efficient. Grandpa would be happy if someone would take the effort to translate the whole thing into Python. :-)


All Credits go to our Grandpa **Josef Wienand** from Werdohl, Germany. Check his riddles here: <https://www.produnis.de/opajupp/>.
